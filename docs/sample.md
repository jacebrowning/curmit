# A Sample File

The contents of this file are hosted as a Google Document, which is published
to the web:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmphl-IBFF-aRcj6n9TZ37YXJMBfmnzPiAGgPNzVj
NE/pub?embedded=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmphl-IBFF-
aRcj6n9TZ37YXJMBfmnzPiAGgPNzVjNE/pub?embedded=true)

## The Flag

To flag this file for `curmit`, the following comment is placed at the
beginning of the Markdown file:

&nbsp_place_holder; &nbsp_place_holder; <!-- curmit:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmphl-IBFF-
aRcj6n9TZ37YXJMBfmnzPiAGgPNzVjNE/pub?embedded=true -->

See the raw text

## Automatic Update

To synchronize this file with the published content:

&nbsp_place_holder; &nbsp_place_holder; curmit

Which does the following:

&nbsp_place_holder;1. searches the tree for files containing "flags"

&nbsp_place_holder;2. grabs the URL contents for each flagged file as text

&nbsp_place_holder;3. replaces the file contents after the flag

&nbsp_place_holder;3. commits/pushes the new contents using `git`

**Cool, huh?**
